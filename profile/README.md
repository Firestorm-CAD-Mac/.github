## 📊 Overview  

Firestorm CAD is a specialized jewelry design platform created for professionals who require precision, flexibility, and high-resolution modeling tools for custom jewelry production. Built with jewelers, designers, manufacturers, and CAD artists in mind, Firestorm CAD provides the advanced toolkit needed to craft rings, pendants, earrings, engagement sets, and intricate ornamental pieces with complete control over every detail.

The software integrates parametric modeling with traditional CAD tools, allowing users to sculpt organic curves, create gemstone settings, generate complex surfaces, and build mechanical components for functional jewelry. Firestorm CAD is engineered to support highly detailed workflows—offering precise measurement systems, real-world dimensions, material libraries, and gemstone catalogs that match professional jewelry standards.

Its intuitive interface helps streamline the entire design process, from initial concept sketching to full 3D construction. Designers can work with dynamic profiles, surface blending tools, beveling modes, advanced Boolean operations, and real-time reshaping features to prototype complex shapes efficiently. Firestorm CAD also includes rendering capabilities that allow creators to preview materials, metals, finishes, and lighting conditions before production.

With its strong focus on jewelry manufacturing, Firestorm CAD includes features for stone placement, prong creation, channel and pavé settings, shank shaping, and automatic generation of production-ready STL files for 3D printing or casting. The platform is widely used in professional workshops for both custom commissions and repeatable manufacturing.

Altogether, Firestorm CAD delivers a complete digital studio for jewelry artists who need speed, accuracy, and dependable modeling tools fit for professional production pipelines.
